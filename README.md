QWC Map Viewer
==============

Provide a [QWC2 Web Client](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app) application using QWC services.

**Note:** requires a QWC OGC service or QGIS server running on `$OGC_SERVICE_URL`, a
QWC Config service running on `$CONFIG_SERVICE_URL` and a QWC Data service running on
`$DATA_SERVICE_URL`

Setup
-----

Copy your QWC2 files from a production build (see [QWC2 Quick start](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/doc/QWC2_Documentation.md#quick-start)):

    SRCDIR=path/to/qwc2-app/prod/ DSTDIR=$PWD
    mkdir $DSTDIR/qwc2 && mkdir $DSTDIR/qwc2/dist
    cd $SRCDIR && \
    cp -r assets $DSTDIR/qwc2 && \
    cp -r translations $DSTDIR/qwc2/translations && \
    cp dist/QWC2App.js $DSTDIR/qwc2/dist/ && \
    cp index.html $DSTDIR/qwc2/ && \
    cp config.json $DSTDIR/qwc2/config.json && \
    cd -

Copy your QWC2 themes config file:

    cp themesConfig.json $DSTDIR/qwc2/


Configuration
-------------

Configure the QWC2 application using your `config.json` file (see [Documentation](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/doc/QWC2_Documentation.md#application-configuration-the-configjson-and-jsappconfigjs-files)).

Add new themes to your `themesConfig.json` (see [Documentation](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app/blob/master/doc/QWC2_Documentation.md#theme-configuration-qgis-projects-and-the-themesconfigjson-file)) and put any theme thumbnails into `$QWC2_PATH/assets/img/mapthumbs/`.
The `themesConfig.json` file is used by the Config service to collect the full themes configuration using GetProjectSettings.


### Custom viewer configurations

Additional viewer configurations can be added by placing a `<viewer>.json`, `<viewer>_qwc.json` and/or `<viewer>.html` for each custom viewer into the `$QWC2_VIEWERS_PATH` directory. The custom viewers can be opened by appending the viewer name to the base URL: `http://localhost:5030/<viewer>/`.

A custom `<viewer>.json` contains the viewer specific themes.
A custom `<viewer>_qwc.json` could e.g. contain a different set of menu items and tools.
A custom `<viewer>.html` could e.g. show a different title and use a custom CSS.

If a `<viewer>.json`, `<viewer>_qwc.json` or `<viewer>.html` is missing, the default `themesConfig.json`, `config.json` or `index.html` is used instead.

**NOTE**: `<viewer>_qwc.json` for the viewer config has been renamed from `<viewer>.json` in previous Map Viewer versions (up to 27f0149c8433c70d1de519ffe9f9a8ebff25e32f).


### Sign in based on request origin

The `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` is used by default for sign in and sign out.

To differentiate e.g between intranet and internet, identity groups based on request origin and different auth service URLs can be configured:

* `ORIGIN_CONFIG`: JSON with rules configuration

    Match by request host:
    ```json
    {
        "host": {
            "<group name>": "<RegEx pattern for host from request>",
            "_intern_": "^127.0.0.1(:\\\\d+)?$"
        }
    }
    ```

    Match by request IP:
    ```json
    {
        "ip": {
            "<group name>": "<RegEx pattern for IP from request>",
            "_intern_": "^127.0.0.\\d{1,3}$"
        }
    }
    ```

    The origin detection can be based on the request host or IP by setting `host` or/and `ip` in `ORIGIN_CONFIG`. The first match is used as the identity group (`_public_` if nothing matched).

* `AUTH_SERVICES_CONFIG`: JSON with lookup of auth service URLs for groups (with fallback to `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`)
    ```json
    {
        "<group name>": "<auth service route or URL>",
        "_intern_": "http://127.0.0.1:5017/"
    }
    ```


Usage
-----

Set the `OGC_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC OGC service URL (or QGIS server URL)
when starting this service. (default: `http://localhost:5013/` on
qwc-ogc-service container)

Set the `CONFIG_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC Config service URL
when starting this service. (default: `http://localhost:5010/` on
qwc-config-service container)

Set the `DATA_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC Data service URL
when starting this service. (default: `http://localhost:5012/` on
qwc-data-service container)

Set the `QWC2_PATH` environment variable to your QWC2 files path.

Optionally:

 * Set the `QWC2_CONFIG` environment variable to your QWC2 `config.json` path if it is not located in `$QWC2_PATH`.
 * Set the `QWC2_VIEWERS_PATH` environment variable to your QWC2 custom viewers path (default: `$QWC2_PATH/viewers/`).
 * Set the `PERMALINK_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC permalink service URL.
 * Set the `ELEVATION_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC elevation service URL.
 * Set the `MAPINFO_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC map info service URL.
 * Set the `DOCUMENT_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC document service URL.
 * Set the `SEARCH_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC search service URL.
 * Set the `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the default QWC auth service URL.
 * Set the `INFO_SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the QWC feature info proxy service URL.

Docker usage
------------

### Run docker image

To run this docker image you will need the following three additional services:

* qwc-postgis
* qwc-qgis-server
* qwc-config-service
* qwc-ogc-service
* qwc-data-service

Those services can be found under https://github.com/qwc-services/. The following steps explain how to download those services and how to run the `qwc-map-viewer` with `docker-compose`.

**Step 1: Clone qwc-docker**

    git clone https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-docker
    cd qwc-docker

**Step 2: Create docker-compose.yml file**

    cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml

**Step 3: Choose between a version of the qwc-map-viewer**

#### qwc-map-viewer-demo

This is the demo version used in the `docker-compose-example.yml` file. With this version, the docker image comes with a preinstalled version of the latest qwc2-demo-app build and the python application for the viewer. Use this docker image, if you don't have your own build of the QWC2 app.

#### qwc-map-viewer-base

If you want to use your own QWC2 build then this is the docker image that you want to use. This docker image comes with only the python application installed on. Here is an example, on how you can add you own QWC2 build to the docker image:

```
qwc-map-viewer:
    image: sourcepole/qwc-map-viewer-base
    environment:
        - CONFIG_SERVICE_URL=http://qwc-config-service:9090/
        - QWC2_PATH=/qwc2/
        - QWC2_CONFIG=/qwc2/config.json
        - OGC_SERVICE_URL=/ows/
        - DATA_SERVICE_URL=/api/v1/data/
    ports:
        - "127.0.0.1:5030:9090"
    # Here you mount your own QWC2 build
    volumes:
    - /PATH_TO_QWC2_BUILD/:/qwc2:ro
    depends_on:
      - qwc-config-service
      - qwc-ogc-service
      - qwc-data-service
```
**Step 4: Build docker containers**

    docker-compose build

**Step 5: Start docker containers**

    docker-compose up qwc-map-viewer
